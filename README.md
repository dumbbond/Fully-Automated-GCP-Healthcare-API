# Authors
Parth Tandel, Priya Singh, Monica Mishra

# Summary
2-3 paragraphs summarizing the problem you wish to solve, including a description of the
dataset(s), and a very brief, non-technical description of your proposed methods.

A major challenge is the lack of a standard way of storing healthcare data.

# Proposed plan of research
2-3 paragraphs describing in detail the methods you will use to solve
the problem. These may be processing, visualization, and statistical and machine learning methods. It
may also include the data science tools and resources you will utilize.

### Data description
The dataset used is MIMIC-III<sup>1</sup> (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’) which is a openly available 
dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. 
This deidentified and comprehensive healthcare information is collected from adult patients admitted to critical care units between 2001 and 2012 at large tertiary care hospitals. 
It includes admissions, demographics, chart notes, fluid balances, vital signs, billing information, laboratory tests, medications, etc.


# Preliminary results
1-2 paragraphs describing any preliminary results you have. At the very least,
this should include some basic summary statistics or exploratory data analysis results from your
dataset(s) or a pilot/preliminary dataset (if you are scraping or mining data).
